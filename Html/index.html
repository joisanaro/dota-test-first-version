                <h3>About Dota 2</h3>
                <p class="description">Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve. The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a "hero", who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large structure located within their base.</p>

                        <p>Dendi, along with Artstyle and LightofHeaven, left DTS to join Na`Vi early 2011. They won The International and ESWC 2011, the latter of which where Dendi's Pudge completely dominated EHOME with blind hooks in the finals, ending with 20 kills, 1 death, and 8 assists cementing his fame as one of the most famous Pudge players on the professional scene.</p>

                        <p>KuroKy played for a few German DotA teams before joining his first international team, mousesports, where he played with players such as Drayich. This mousesports lineup attended DreamHack Winter 2008 with Puppey acting as stand-in; this was to be the beginning of a long relationship between KuroKy and Puppey. KuroKy then joined Ks.int, which at one point had a total number of 9 players and looked more like a mix than an actual team.</p>

                        <p>Puppey is one of the most prolific and storied captains in Dota. He is not afraid to experiment, even in important matches. Despite the fact that he plays Jungler and Support most often, he is effective in any role.Puppey's good knowledge of the English language allowed him to play in many of the best European teams. Clement is an open and sociable man.</p>

                        <p>MidOne had a profound interest in video games when he was a child. His first video game he played was Tetris on a Gameboy when he was 3â€“4 years old and later moved to console gaming playing the Final Fantasy series on the Playstation 1. At the age of 7 he played his first computer games: Sonic and Rayman before playing venturing into DotA when he saw his brother playing it.</p>
